My name is Anna and I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I'm currently working with Professor Caroline Trippel in the Stanford High Assurance Computer Architectures Lab, where I study security implications of hardware-software systems. Prior to this, I graduated from Princeton University Summa Cum Laude with a B.S.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a certificate in Optimization and Quantitative Decision Science. My undergraduate thesis in network security, "Off-path Website Fingerprinting Through Shared Hardware Bottlenecks," was awarded the ECE department research prize.
